# Data
data/*.csv # If you want to exclude the raw data (but for this project, you might want to include it)
# If your dataset is very large and you don't want it on GitHub, uncomment the line above
# For this project, it's small enough to include, so keep it commented or remove.

# Models
models/*.pkl # Your saved model file (lightgbm_model.pkl)
# It's generally good practice NOT to upload large binary model files to Git.
# Users can regenerate it by running run_project.py.
# If you MUST include it (e.g., for quick demo), comment this line out.

# Plots
*.png # Your evaluation plots (actual_vs_predicted_salary_lightgbm.png, residuals_distribution_lightgbm.png)
# These are generated outputs, so it's good practice to ignore them.
